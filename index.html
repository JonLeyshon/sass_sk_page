              <h3>The Shining</h3>
              <p>
                The Shining is a horror novel by American author Stephen King.
                Published in 1977, it is King's third published novel and first
                hardback bestseller, and the success of the book firmly
                established King as a preeminent author in the horror genre.
              </p>
              <p>
                The setting and characters are influenced by King's personal
                experiences, including both his visit to The Stanley Hotel in
                1974 and his recovery from alcoholism. The novel was followed by
                a sequel, Doctor Sleep, published in 2013.
              </p>
              <p>
                The novel was adapted into a 1980 feature film of the same name
                directed by Stanley Kubrick and co-written with Diane Johnson.

              <h3>It</h3>
              <p>
                The story of It follows the experiences of seven children as
                they are terrorized by an evil entity that exploits the fears of
                its victims to disguise itself while hunting its prey. "It"
                primarily appears in the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown to
                attract its preferred prey of young children.
              </p>
              <p>
                The novel is told through narratives alternating between two
                periods and is largely told in the third-person omniscient mode.
                It deals with themes that eventually became King staples: the
                power of memory, childhood trauma and its recurrent echoes in
                adulthood, the malevolence lurking beneath the idyllic fa√ßade of
                the American small town, and overcoming evil through mutual
                trust and sacrifice.
              </p>
              <p>
                The novel won the British Fantasy Award in 1987, and received
                nominations for the Locus and World Fantasy Awards that same
                year. Publishers Weekly listed It as the best-selling hardcover
                fiction book in the United States in 1986.

              <h3>Carrie</h3>
              <p>
                The novella published by Stephen King. Set in Chamberlain,
                Maine, the plot revolves around Carrie White, a friendless,
                bullied high-school girl from an abusive religious household who
                discovers she has telekinetic powers.
              </p>
              <p>
                King started writing Carrie, intended to be a short story for
                the men's magazine Cavalier, after a friend's suggestion to
                write a story of a female character. Though King initially gave
                up on Carrie due to discomfort and apathy, and felt it would
                never be successful, his wife Tabitha convinced him to continue
                writing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Carrie was published on April 5, 1974, with a print run of
                30,000 copies, and a paperback edition was published by New
                American Library in April 1975. The paperback edition became a
                bestseller, particularly after the release of the 1976 film
                adaptation, reaching four million sales.
